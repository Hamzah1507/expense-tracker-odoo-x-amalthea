## üèóÔ∏è Database Schema

### Core Tables
1. **users_company** - Company information
2. **users_user** - User accounts with roles
3. **expenses_expensecategory** - Expense categories
4. **expenses_expense** - Main expense records
5. **expenses_approvalrule** - Approval rule configuration
6. **expenses_approvalstep** - Approval workflow steps
7. **expenses_expenseapproval** - Individual approvals
8. **expenses_notification** - User notifications

## üîß Configuration Required

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Add to .env file
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
DEBUG=True
ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1

# External APIs
EXCHANGE_RATE_API_KEY=your-api-key
OCR_SERVICE_API_KEY=your-ocr-api-key
```

### Dependencies to Install
```bash
pip install django-cors-headers
pip install pillow  # For image handling
pip install requests  # For external API calls
```

## üé® Frontend Implementation Plan

### Employee Dashboard
- Expense submission form with OCR upload
- Expense history with status tracking
- Receipt scanning interface
- Currency conversion display

### Manager Dashboard
- Pending approvals queue
- Team expense overview
- Approval workflow management
- Bulk approval actions

### Admin Dashboard
- Company management
- User role management
- Approval rule configuration
- System analytics and reports

## üîÑ Workflow Implementation

### Expense Submission Flow
1. Employee creates expense (draft)
2. Employee uploads receipt (OCR processing)
3. Employee submits for approval
4. System applies approval rules
5. Notifications sent to approvers
6. Sequential approval process
7. Final approval/rejection

### Approval Rule Types
1. **Percentage Rule**: X% of approvers must approve
2. **Specific Approver**: Specific person must approve
3. **Hybrid Rule**: Combination of percentage and specific
4. **Manager First**: Manager approval required before others
